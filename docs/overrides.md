# Overrides

Each field layout (ie: each Entry Type) can have its own configuration of Matrix groups & tabs.

:::warning Hiding Block Types or Fields
If you'd like to hide a specific block type or block field, just **leave it out of the override!** Any block type or field that isn't included will simply be omitted.

## Default Configuration

When you configure Spoon via the [Settings](/getting-started/settings/) page, you are setting the **default configuration** for all instances of that Matrix field.

Once you have a default configuration in place, however, it's easy to **override the configuration** for each field layout (like an Entry Type) where it is being used.

## Override Configuration

To override a default config, click on the "Spoon" button **when managing a field layout**.

The example below shows the process of configuring a typical Entry Type...

Within this context, follow the same steps outlined for [Matrix Block Groups](/matrix-block-groups/) & [Matrix Block Tabs](/matrix-block-tabs/).
