# Matrix Block Groups

## Description

When configuring a Matrix field with the Spoon plugin, the first step is to **organize the block types into logical groups**. Those block types will then be available from within a group...

:::warning Nested Settings Menu Display Mode
If preferred, you can switch the grouping to a [nested display mode...](/getting-started/config/#nested-settings-menu-display-mode)

## Configuration

You can manage the block group settings of each Matrix field by going to the **Settings > Spoon** page.

Select any existing Matrix field to organize its block types into groups.

Once you have created some block type groups, you'll then be able to manage the [Matrix block tabs](/matrix-block-tabs/).
