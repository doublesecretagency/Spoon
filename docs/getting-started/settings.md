# Settings Page

In order to access the settings, log in to your control panel and visit **Settings > Spoon**.

You will see a list of all existing Matrix fields...

This is where you will manage the **block group & tab** configuration for each of your Matrix fields. These will be considered the main (default) field configurations.

## Managing Block Groups

On the Spoon settings page, click the Matrix field you would like to manage. You'll be able to organize its blocks into logical [Matrix Block Groups](/matrix-block-groups/).

## Managing Block Tabs

Once you've organized your block groups, click on the gear icon for the block you would like to manage. This will open another modal, in which you'll be able to manage the [Matrix Block Tabs](/matrix-block-tabs/).

## Overriding Main Configs

In addition to the default configs, you can optionally [override](/overrides/) each config for separate field layouts (for example, individual Entry Types).
