# Spoon plugin for Craft CMS

**Bend your Matrix fields with block groups & tabs.**

---

## Wish your Matrix blocks were a little better organized?

Spoon lets you organize your [block types into groups](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/spoon/matrix-block-groups/), and split your [block fields into tabs](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/spoon/matrix-block-tabs/).

</p>

You can even [hide block types & fields](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/spoon/overrides/) from specific layouts (ie: Entry Types).

## Spoon doesn't touch your data!

It simply provides a shinier UX for existing Matrix fields. If you ever choose to uninstall it, all of your data will remain intact.

## Managing Groups & Tabs

You can manage your groups and tabs using the familiar drag & drop interface...
